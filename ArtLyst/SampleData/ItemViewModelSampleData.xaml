    Description="London – On 24 April 2014 Christie’s Mayfair will open Polke/Richter-Richter/Polke, celebrating two giants of painting: Gerhard Richter (b.1932) and Sigmar Polke (1941-2010). The show brings together 65 works from 30 collections to create the artists’ first joint show in almost 50 years, since their now legendary 1966 exhibition at Galerie h in Hanover. This show was a declaration of their intention to resurrect painting, a medium presumed dead, by deconstructing it and opening up new possibilities. Christie’s Polke/Richter-Richter/Polke reunites two of the works from this show (Flemish Crown, by Richter and Bavarian by Polke, illustrated below), as well as others from the period, and then surveys the artists’ careers since then, until Polke’s death."
